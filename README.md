# NFL_Draft_Selector
This is a project from my class on Decision Support Systems. It was created using the YII Framework.  It was a group project with classmates Jawad Wagan, Michael Dempsey, and Malik Farhan.

It uses a ranked-weighting system.  Each team has their own profile, and selects which positions are most important, as well as how many of each position the team is looking to draft.  This is combined with player ratings from professional sports analysts to give a list of draft options for each pick.
